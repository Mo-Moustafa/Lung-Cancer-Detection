# Lung-Cancer-Detection

This dataset of lung cancer was collected over a period of 3 months in fall 2019 by the Iraq-Oncology teaching hospital/national center for cancer (you can find the data here: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/bhmdr45bh2/1).
It consists of CT scans of either patients who are diagnosed with lung cancer in 2 different stages (benign, and malignant) or healthy ones. Those CT scans are originally saved in DICOM format (Digital Imaging and Communication).
Each scan contains several slices that show an image of human chest from different sides and angles. All cases vary in gender, age, area of residence and living status.

Using Computer Vision to Preprocess the data and Random Forest for Classification.
